## Description
Model Transformation project created for Graphics Programming class written in C++.
The program load in .obj files from the data directory and you can apply transformations to them using the keyboard

## Running Locally
Created by Gavin Baltar and Donald Arango

- Run the makefile in the root directory
    - This was run on a mac, so if there are any issues let us know, because we can attempt to help for running on windows.
- The program then asks for input
    - Enter a file name (without a .obj extension)
        - Ex: cube, triangles, monke, couch, dolphins
    - Enter if you want the model transformation calculated on the CPU or GPU (y for GPU, n for CPU)
- Model Transformation Input:
    - Translation: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT arrow keys (moving in the direction of the arrow key)
    - Rotation: W, A, S, D, Q, E (rotating around the x, y, and z axes, respectively)
    - Scale: 1,2  (scaling down and up)
- Enjoy!
